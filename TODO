fix event edit after using "new event"
fix quickrecord
escape all url_fors
:escape => false  on url_for

Unrelatedly, the view_dates page doesn't properly order sub-events by date.  For example, look at
https://abtt.hackish.org/event/view_dates/6.  You should probably fix this, Saagar.

Finance
- allow account/unpaid to take a date in the form of 10/11/06 when creating a paid invoice

events page
- 'create new' should only be visible to some people. 
- we should think about what statuses we want on the page 
  - i think i'm going to do this part with colors like two similar alternating
    colors for normal events and some different colors for different statuses.
    for example, cancelled events might be greyed out, required action events
    might be red......what else might we want to pull out?
  - is it possible that we might want to restrict viewing of cancelled events?
    or perhaps of statuses in general?

members
- 'listing members' needs to be a different title
- show and destroy unnecessary here too. destroy can be an option under edit.
  - click on line to edit? (i kindof like this idea, can you tell?)
- in kerbid, maybe we should truncate the @andrew.cmu.edu? 
  - when we have @abtech support, just leave it at @abtech
- created_at and updated_at are probably unnecessary.
- is nickname necessary?
- probably roles should not be on this chart, or even displayed publically at
  all.


organizations
- 'listing organizations' change title
- show and destroy unnecessary, destroy under edit, click line to edit, etc
- is pagination necessary?
  - if we deem it so, make sure the next page button is in the same place
    every time.

calendar
- i think maybe calendar and event view should be integrated with each other.
  - or if we integrated it with events, we could have one month with info along
    the side
- i don't think the 'how to tweak the generated ics file' info is really
  important. if people are like me they will just generate the whole file and
  smile a lot.
